NS2 Simulator Steps

1. Introduction:
   - NS2 is a network simulator for simulating protocols and network scenarios.

2. Simulate to Find Number of Packets Dropped:
   - Write a TCL script to define nodes, links, and traffic.
   - Run: ns example.tcl
   - Use: awk '/^d/ {drop++} END {print drop}' out.tr

3. Simulate to Find Packets Dropped by TCP/UDP:
   - Filter trace file for TCP/UDP drops using awk or grep.

4. Simulate to Find Packets Dropped due to Congestion:
   - Analyze trace file for congestion events (look for 'd' events).

5. Simulate to Compare Data Rate & Throughput:
   - Calculate throughput from trace file: awk '{sum+=$5} END {print sum/time}' out.tr

6. Simulate to Plot Congestion for Different Source/Destination:
   - Use trace file data and plot using gnuplot or Excel.

7. Simulate to Determine Performance for Transmission of Packets:
   - Analyze trace file for sent/received packets.

Refer to your manual for sample TCL scripts and trace file analysis.
