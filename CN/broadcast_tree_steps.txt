Broadcast Tree for Subnet

Steps:
1. Draw the network graph with all hosts and routers.
2. Choose a root node (usually the router).
3. Use BFS (Breadth First Search) or DFS (Depth First Search) to traverse all nodes.
4. Mark the shortest path from root to each host.
5. The union of all shortest paths forms the broadcast tree.

Example:
- For a subnet with hosts A, B, C, D connected to router R:
  - R connects to A, B, C, D directly.
  - Broadcast tree: R-A, R-B, R-C, R-D
