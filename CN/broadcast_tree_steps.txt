BROADCAST TREE IN COMPUTER NETWORKS

**Definition:**
A broadcast tree is a spanning tree of a network graph, rooted at a source node (such as a router), 
that allows a message to be sent from the root to all other nodes efficiently, without sending the
 same message multiple times over the same link. It ensures every node receives the broadcast exactly once,
using the minimum number of links.

**Typical Question:**
Given a subnet (network) of hosts and routers, construct a broadcast tree for the subnet. 
Print the set of edges that form the broadcast tree, starting from a given root node.

**Logic and Steps:**
1. Represent the network as a graph (nodes = hosts/routers, edges = connections).
2. Choose a root node (usually the router or the node initiating the broadcast).
3. Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the network from the root. 
BFS ensures each node is reached by the shortest path and no cycles are formed.
4. For each new node visited, record the edge from its parent (the node from which it was discovered). 
These edges together form the broadcast tree.
5. Continue until all nodes are visited.

**Why BFS?**
BFS is used because it explores the network level by level, ensuring the shortest path from the root to each 
node and preventing cycles, which is essential for a tree structure.

DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP DRY RUN AND EXPLANATION: BROADCAST TREE

Problem Statement:
Given a network (as an adjacency matrix) and a root node, construct a broadcast tree using BFS and print the edges that form the tree.

**Sample Input:**
Enter number of nodes: 5
Enter adjacency matrix:
0 1 1 0 0
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
Enter root node: 0

**Step 1: Build the Graph**
The adjacency matrix is read and converted to adjacency lists for each node:
- Node 0: [1, 2]
- Node 1: [0, 3, 4]
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [1]

**Step 2: Initialize BFS**
- Mark the root node (0) as visited.
- Initialize a queue and add the root node: queue = [0]

**Step 3: BFS Traversal and Tree Construction**
We process nodes in the queue one by one, visiting their neighbors:

1. **Pop 0 from queue:**
	- Neighbors: 1, 2
	- 1 is not visited: print edge 0-1, mark 1 as visited, queue.push(1)
	- 2 is not visited: print edge 0-2, mark 2 as visited, queue.push(2)
	- Queue now: [1, 2]

2. **Pop 1 from queue:**
	- Neighbors: 0, 3, 4
	- 0 is already visited
	- 3 is not visited: print edge 1-3, mark 3 as visited, queue.push(3)
	- 4 is not visited: print edge 1-4, mark 4 as visited, queue.push(4)
	- Queue now: [2, 3, 4]

3. **Pop 2 from queue:**
	- Neighbor: 0 (already visited)
	- Queue now: [3, 4]

4. **Pop 3 from queue:**
	- Neighbor: 1 (already visited)
	- Queue now: [4]

5. **Pop 4 from queue:**
	- Neighbor: 1 (already visited)
	- Queue now: []

**Step 4: Output the Broadcast Tree Edges**
The edges printed during the traversal are:
0 - 1
0 - 2
1 - 3
1 - 4

**Step 5: Explanation of the Output**
- Each edge represents a direct connection from a parent (the node from which a neighbor was discovered) to a child (the newly visited node).
- BFS ensures that each node is reached by the shortest path from the root, and no cycles are formed.
- The set of printed edges forms a spanning tree rooted at the source, covering all nodes with the minimum number of links.

**Summary:**
This process constructs a broadcast tree using BFS. The tree allows a message to be sent from the root to all nodes efficiently, with each edge representing a single transmission. The dry run above shows exactly how the tree is built step by step for the given input, and why each edge appears in the output.
